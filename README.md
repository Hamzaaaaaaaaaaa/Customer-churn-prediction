Customer churn is a big problem in any industry and one of the most important concerns for the Telecom industry. The effect on the revenues of the companies, because of this customer churns is huge, especially in the telecom field, that's why these companies are seeking to develop a predictive potential customer churn. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate, and it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, that's why customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

Therefore, finding those factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn.
